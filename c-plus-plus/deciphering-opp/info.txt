Standard data types in C++ include the following:
• int: To store whole numbers
• float: To store floating point values
• double: To store double precision floating point values
• char: To store a single character
• bool: For boolean values of true or false

== It is important to note that the C++ community is moving away from native C++ strings 
   that is, those implemented using an array of (or pointer to) characters.

The iostream library
  cin can be used in conjunction with the extraction operator >> for buffered input
  cout can be used in conjunction with the insertion operator << for buffered output
  cerr (unbuffered) and clog (buffered) can also be used in conjunction with the insertion operator, but for errors

Basic iostream manipulators (defined in the <iomanip> header file.): 
• endl: Places a newline character ('\n') in the buffer associated with cout then flushes the buffer
• flush: Clears the contents of the output stream
• setprecision(int): Defines the precision (number of digits) used to output floating point numbers
• setw(int): Sets the width for input and output
• ws: Removes whitespace characters from the buffer
